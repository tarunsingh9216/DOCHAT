## About The Project

This project is a document-based chatbot that allows users to upload PDF documents and ask questions about the content. The system uses **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** to find relevant information from the document and provides answers using a Large Language Model (LLM). The chatbot is designed to work with PDFs, using **AWS Textract** and **PyPDF** for text extraction. It leverages **AWS Bedrock**, specifically **AWS Textract** and **AWS Anthropic Claude**, to generate the most relevant answers.

### Key Features
- Upload PDF documents for easy question-answering.
- Utilizes **AWS Textract** and **PyPDF** for extracting text from PDFs.
- **AWS Claude** LLM provides highly relevant answers using extracted content.
- Streamlit-based web application for a smooth and interactive user interface.

## Built With

This project leverages the following technologies:
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: For retrieving and generating answers from the document.
- **AWS Bedrock**: To integrate AI services, including Textract and Claude.
- **AWS Textract**: To extract text from PDF documents.
- **PyPDF**: As an alternative method for text extraction.
- **AWS Anthropic Claude**: The large language model for generating answers.
- **Streamlit**: To build the web application and user interface.


### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- AWS Account
- Streamlit
- AWS CLI configured with Textract and Bedrock permissions
